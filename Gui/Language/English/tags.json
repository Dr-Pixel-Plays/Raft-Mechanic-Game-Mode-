If you could bring Berth- eh, me some packed veggies, that would be great! Hehe.. I marked a nearby packing station for you. Pack 2 crates each of carrots and redbeets. Then you can bring them to big ol' Bertha- eh, the big pump over there.. Hehe.",

You should investigate this.",

I can make as much as you need, as long as you bring me fresh supplies. Eh, of course this was necessary.. because.. the.. ah.. sunshake contains, ah, coordinates to some ruins. Since my life is saved by sunshake now, you might as well try to free the rest of my crew. I heard rumors about some key hidden in that ruined city. If I could get my hands on such a device, we might be able to start a rescue mission.",

Just don't ask why there are so many water bottles in the ocean.. Anyway, reach the top of a warehouse and rescue one of them! Then come over to me and big ol' Bertha will take care of them.",
